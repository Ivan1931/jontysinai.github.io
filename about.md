Hey, I'm Mandla,
I consider myself a lifelong learner and explorer. The best way I have tend to learn in through experience (especially painful ones). I'm introverted in nature so I prefer to write things down. I have spoken at a number of conferences about learning and things that excite me. 

I have founded The Coding Ground with two great guys. Check it out here: http://thecodingground.com.
