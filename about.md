Welcome to my blog. I'm currently studying mathematics at the Cambridge University. I'm curious about the world, and am taking this journey one step at a time. Mathematics is something that I stumbled upon during university, and the more I learned, the more hooked I became. It is said that mathematics is the language of the universe, and I see it everywhere: patterns, colour, diversity, relationships, intelligence. I'm on this journey because I think I've found my True North, and that means believing in more.
