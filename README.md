mediator
========

A medium inspired Jekyll blog theme. The basic idea came from the Ghost theme
[Readium 2.0](http://www.svenread.com/readium-ghost-theme/). I use mediator on my own blog .


Features
-------
* Fully Responsive layout
* Use header images in articles, if you want to (add tag "image" and url to the image in the front matter section of a post)
* Minimal design
* Featured article support
* FontAwesome implemented for easy use of icons fonts
* Free & Open Source Font usage

Getting Started
